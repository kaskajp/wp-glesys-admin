#Upgrade the memory of a remote virtual server using GleSYS API

Author: [Emil Andersson](/emil-nasso)

This short and basic BASH-script upgrades (or downgrades) the memory of a server based on the current amount and current usage. It gets the memory usage information from the GleSYS API. It also upgrades using GleSYS API.

This script could easily be run as a cron-job to upgrade and downgrade a server depending on the current needs.
