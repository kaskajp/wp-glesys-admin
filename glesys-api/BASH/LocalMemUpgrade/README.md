#Upgrade memory on local server

Author: [Emil Andersson](/emil-nasso)

This simple scripts checks if the server has used more than 90% of its memory. If it has, it upgrades to 2048mb memory.

There are alot of possible improvements that should probably be added to this script before being used in production but it serves good as an example. One problem is that is probably wont be able to run if the server has 100% used memory.
